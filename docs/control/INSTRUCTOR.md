# Instructor Control

Control schema/version: `LEVEL2-V1`

Instruction ID: `INS-074`

Status: `HOLD`

Allowed statuses: `HOLD`, `APPROVED_FOR_EXECUTION`, `NEEDS_HUMAN_DECISION`

## INS-074 — Independent post-INS-073 audit hold

This is the current Instructor signal and supersedes `INS-073 /
APPROVED_FOR_EXECUTION`. The N-03A implementation and N-03 closure passed
independent review and were integrated at commit `f320b5f1d7731d121db27e788cffa4a8033dc7fd`.
Execution is now on HOLD because the latest Manager checkpoint still contains
one stale statement about the worker paths being uncommitted.

### Verified checkpoint

- Branch: `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`; current HEAD is `f320b5f1d7731d121db27e788cffa4a8033dc7fd`.
- The working tree was clean after the audited integration commit. The commit
  contains only the three reviewed N-03A News paths and the Manager-owned
  `TASKS.md`/`HANDOFF.md` checkpoint changes; the Instructor did not implement
  feature code.
- `TASKS.md` records `N-03A=DONE` and `N-03=DONE`; `M-02` remains
  `REVIEW/UNVERIFIED`; `AU-02`, `S-04`, `E-02`, `L-02`, `F-03`, `I-01`,
  `I-02`, and `I-03` remain `BLOCKED`.
- The INS-073 Manager and its single News worker are complete and archived;
  no Cryptox Manager, worker, duplicate, or retry is active.

### Independent evidence

- N-03A scheduler `5/5`, News `35/35`, Sentiment `19/19`, and public News API
  `3/3` passed.
- Root workspace tests passed `346` with `6` environment-gated skips; skips
  are not PASS evidence. Root/package typecheck, build, lint, architecture,
  artifacts, deferred-scope/checker, and diff checks exited successfully.
- The worker changed only `modules/news/application/scheduler.ts`,
  `modules/news/application/scheduler.spec.ts`, and the minimal scheduler
  export in `modules/news/api/bootstrap.ts`. No contracts, infrastructure,
  migration, dependency, or unrelated source path changed.

### Reconciliation required before the next feature authorization

- The latest `HANDOFF.md` correctly records the Manager's one staging failure,
  but its final sentence still says the reviewed worker paths remain
  uncommitted. That is stale after `f320b5f`.
- The Instructor will not edit `TASKS.md` or `HANDOFF.md`. A fresh Manager must
  receive a separate control-only authorization to reconcile those two files
  with the actual integrated commit, then stop. No feature implementation,
  retry, replacement, downstream promotion, `M-02`, `AU-02`, `I-01`, `I-02`,
  or deferred packet is authorized under this HOLD.

### Evidence limitations

Real configured News/Binance, PostgreSQL/Docker runtime, browser/demo runtime,
OpenSpec CLI, and link/DAG automation remain `UNVERIFIED` or `BLOCKED` where
applicable. Fixtures and skipped tests are not promoted to PASS.

## Historical INS-073 — N-03A News auto-refresh completion and N-03 closure

This replaceable signal supersedes `INS-072 / HOLD` and authorizes exactly one
fresh Manager and exactly one fresh News worker for the residual `N-03A`
completion packet. It authorizes no retry of the completed N-03 worker, no
other implementation, and no downstream start.

### Reviewed checkpoint and current frontier

- Branch: `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`; current HEAD is `1fda6ad`
  (`docs(control): approve N-03A refresh completion`). The parent Instructor
  reviewed the governance-only plan/decision delta and Git is clean.
- The operational board currently contains 32 `DONE`, 2 `REVIEW` (`M-02`,
  `N-03`), and 8 `BLOCKED` (`AU-02`, `S-04`, `I-01`, `I-02`, `E-02`, `L-02`,
  `F-03`, `I-03`) rows, 42 existing rows total. `N-03A` is newly planned in
  `MVP_PLAN.md` and must be added as a separate operational row by the Manager
  before it is executable.
- M-03 is `DONE` under INS-071 at `280b280`; C-02, C-03, Q-02, B-03,
  ENV-03, and ENV-04 remain `DONE`. N-03 source/business state remains at
  `d4161ec458c869ff18fa89dd9732df260629c915`; its safe-fetch, extraction,
  retention, provenance, and neutral Sentiment evidence is preserved, but its
  checkpoint explicitly records that only the 1–5 minute setting/default exists
  and no scheduler is implemented.
- `DEC-014` and `MVP_PLAN.md` now define N-03A as completion of the approved
  `CSL-R-NW-02` behavior. They do not expand product scope, reopen N-03 source
  history, or authorize downstream tasks. Real PostgreSQL, configured Binance
  and News providers, browser/demo runtime, link/DAG automation, and OpenSpec
  CLI evidence remain `UNVERIFIED` or `BLOCKED` where recorded. No unavailable
  check, fixture, or skipped test is treated as `PASS`.

### Authorized packet and delegation

- Create exactly one fresh Manager in the canonical same-directory checkout
  `D:/agy-cli-projects/AOS/Cryptox`, branch `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`, with model
  `gpt-5.6-luna` and `xhigh` reasoning. It must read `AGENTS.md` and
  `docs/control/prompts/ORCHESTRATOR_START.md` completely, then verify this
  signal, the new N-03A plan/decision, Git, TASKS, HANDOFF, the DAG,
  dependencies, and active tasks.
- The Manager must add exactly one `N-03A` operational row to `TASKS.md` in
  `READY` state, with the packet's requirement IDs, dependencies, exact scope,
  and stop evidence. It must then move only N-03A through
  `READY -> IN_PROGRESS` before dispatching the worker. Existing N-03 remains
  `REVIEW` until the residual acceptance is proven; it must not be retried or
  moved to another state before then.
- Delegate exactly one fresh News worker after the READY/dependency check. The
  worker must use the canonical same-directory checkout, must not create a
  thread/worker, branch, worktree, commit, or control-plane edit, and must not
  edit `TASKS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `INSTRUCTOR.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
  `MVP_PLAN.md`, requirements, ADRs, or OpenSpec artifacts. No retry,
  replacement, duplicate, or second worker is authorized.
- **Worker write scope:** `modules/news/api/**` excluding `contracts.ts` and
  contract-only tests; `modules/news/application/**`; and focused News
  scheduler tests in those boundaries. No infrastructure change is authorized;
  if the implementation genuinely requires one, stop and report
  `NEEDS_INSTRUCTOR_REVIEW`. No Sentiment, Strategy, frontend, backend
  composition root, contract, migration, dependency, credential, arbitrary
  URL, queue, distributed, or unrelated source change is authorized.
- **Manager-owned scope:** only `docs/implementation/TASKS.md` and
  `docs/implementation/HANDOFF.md` for the N-03A row, N-03 closure, review,
  and checkpoint. The Manager must preserve every unrelated task state and
  stop before S-04, E-02, L-02, F-03, I-01, I-02, I-03, AU-02, M-02, or any
  other packet.

### Acceptance and validation

- Implement a provider-neutral, application-owned, testable scheduler that
  accepts the existing configured 1–5 minute interval and five-minute default,
  invokes the existing public News collection at each interval, prevents
  overlapping collection runs, isolates a failed refresh so later ticks remain
  possible, and shuts down idempotently so no future tick runs. It must not
  perform direct remote fetching, persist timer state, log secrets, or create a
  queue/distributed worker protocol.
- Tests must cover cadence, default and invalid intervals, non-overlap, failure
  continuation, and shutdown using injected timer/clock seams. The public API
  must remain contract-compatible and later runtime integration must be able to
  consume the scheduler through the News boundary.
- The Manager must review exact changed paths and re-run the original N-03
  focused News/Sentiment tests plus N-03A tests, relevant public API tests,
  current checker and `scope:check`, architecture, artifacts, typecheck, build,
  lint, and `git diff --check`. Real configured News, PostgreSQL, browser/demo,
  OpenSpec CLI, and link/DAG automation remain `UNVERIFIED`/`BLOCKED` when
  unavailable; fixtures and skips are not live-provider evidence.
- If the residual evidence is complete, move N-03A through
  `IN_PROGRESS -> REVIEW -> DONE`, then move the existing N-03 exactly
  `REVIEW -> DONE` under this authorization and record both transitions. If a
  material premise is false, keep N-03A/N-03 at the safe state, record the
  exact blocker, and stop. Attempt one coherent Manager checkpoint commit
  containing only TASKS/HANDOFF; if Git staging/commit is denied, report it once
  and do not retry or broaden scope.
- The Manager must stop immediately after the N-03A review and optional N-03
  closure. No downstream promotion is implied by this instruction.
