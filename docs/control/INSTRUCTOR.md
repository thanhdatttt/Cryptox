# Instructor Control

Control schema/version: `LEVEL2-V1`

Instruction ID: `INS-077`

Status: `APPROVED_FOR_EXECUTION`

Allowed statuses: `HOLD`, `APPROVED_FOR_EXECUTION`, `NEEDS_HUMAN_DECISION`

## INS-077 — S-04 controlled LLM authoring

This current signal supersedes `INS-076 / HOLD` and authorizes exactly one
bounded `S-04` implementation. It authorizes no other packet, retry,
replacement, duplicate, or downstream promotion.

### Reviewed checkpoint and authority

- Branch: `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`; reviewed base is
  `723d1700bd39c4417cbfe13ca6a56bdb8a4ce378` (`docs(control): hold after
  INS-075 audit`). The working tree was clean at review and no Cryptox Manager
  or worker was active.
- The authority chain agrees: `DEC-007`, `ADR-009`, the approved
  `CSL-R-ST-05`/`CSL-R-RP-02` requirements and safe-content join
  `CSL-R-NW-02`, `openspec/specs/strategy/spec.md`, and the `S-04` packet in
  `MVP_PLAN.md`/`TASKS.md` define the same controlled authoring boundary.
- Start dependencies are verified from `TASKS.md`: `C-02`, `S-01`, and the
  URL-origin prerequisite `N-03`/`N-03A` are `DONE`. `S-05`, `S-06`, `Q-02`,
  `B-03`, and `M-03` are also `DONE`. `F-03`, `AU-02`, and `I-03` are
  integration dependencies only and remain blocked; they are not authorized by
  this signal.
- The operational board remains `34 DONE`, `1 REVIEW` (`M-02`), and
  `8 BLOCKED`. `TASKS.md` remains the sole operational-state authority.

### Exact Manager and worker authorization

- Create exactly one fresh Manager in the canonical same-directory checkout
  `D:/agy-cli-projects/AOS/Cryptox`, branch `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`, using model
  `gpt-5.6-luna` with `max` reasoning. The Manager must read `AGENTS.md` and
  `docs/control/prompts/ORCHESTRATOR_START.md` completely, verify this signal
  and base checkpoint from Git, check the DAG/dependencies and active-task list,
  and stop if any material premise or source/business state drifted.
- The Manager may create exactly one fresh Strategy application worker for
  `S-04`, with a disjoint source write scope. No second worker, retry,
  replacement, worktree, branch, or duplicate Manager is allowed.
- The Manager alone may update `docs/implementation/TASKS.md` and
  `docs/implementation/HANDOFF.md`; the worker must not edit any control-plane
  artifact. The Manager must stop after the S-04 review/checkpoint.

### Packet, requirements, and exact write scope

- Packet: `S-04 — Controlled LLM_AUTHORING_V1 Strategy Drafts`.
- Requirement IDs: `CSL-R-ST-05`, `CSL-R-RP-02`, and the safe imported-content
  join in `CSL-R-NW-02`.
- Allowed implementation scope: `modules/strategy/api/**` excluding
  `contracts.ts` and contract-only tests; `modules/strategy/application/**`
  for authoring implementation/repositories excluding the canonical
  `ports.ts`; `modules/strategy/infrastructure/**` for the provider adapter;
  and focused Strategy authoring tests. Existing frozen contracts may be read
  and consumed but not changed.
- Forbidden scope: `modules/strategy/api/contracts.ts`,
  `modules/strategy/application/ports.ts`, canonical REST contracts,
  `modules/strategy/domain/**`, `modules/news/**`, direct URL fetching or News
  persistence, migrations, dependencies, frontend, backend composition,
  credentials/secrets, queues/distributed execution, automatic approval, and
  every unrelated source or control-plane file.

### Acceptance, validation, and stop condition

- Implement a provider-neutral, configured OpenAI-compatible demo adapter that
  makes at most one request per prompt or approved-News-item submission, has a
  hard 45-second timeout, performs no retry/queue behavior, and never exposes
  or persists provider secrets, raw prompts, or raw completions.
- Produce a structured draft only; deterministic schema/domain validation must
  precede any persistence. Missing configuration, timeout, provider failure,
  malformed draft, rejected validation, and rejected approval must have no
  persistence side effect.
- Require an explicit authenticated Save/Approve action to create exactly one
  immutable owner-scoped Strategy Definition version with safe authoring origin
  metadata. Cross-user reads/mutations must have the approved not-found
  behavior. An URL-origin submission may use only the existing safe News public
  boundary and approved News item; Strategy must never fetch the URL directly.
- Add focused unit/contract/owner-approval/no-write/timeout/provenance tests,
  then run applicable Strategy tests and package typecheck/build/lint plus
  repository scope, architecture, artifact, deferred-scope, and diff checks.
  Configured real-provider or PostgreSQL/browser evidence is recorded as
  `PASS` only when actually run; unavailable evidence remains `UNVERIFIED` or
  `BLOCKED`, never inherited from fixtures or skipped tests.
- Move only `S-04` through the normal operational sequence
  `BLOCKED -> READY -> IN_PROGRESS -> REVIEW -> DONE` when evidence warrants
  it. Do not start or promote `F-03`, `AU-02`, `I-01`, `I-02`, `I-03`, `E-02`,
  `L-02`, `M-02`, or any other packet. After one Manager checkpoint commit
  attempt and report, stop for independent Instructor review.

## Historical INS-076 — Post-INS-075 independent audit hold

This historical signal recorded the independent Instructor review after `INS-075`.
It authorizes no Manager, worker, implementation, retry, replacement, closure
review, downstream promotion, or other task-state transition.

### Reviewed checkpoint

- Branch: `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`; the reviewed HEAD is
  `19164a65d89b51215f031dd99619726f34271353` (`docs(control): reconcile
  INS-073 checkpoint`). The working tree was clean before this signal, and no
  competing Cryptox Manager or worker was active.
- `INS-075` completed its control-only authorization. Its Manager changed only
  `docs/implementation/TASKS.md` and `docs/implementation/HANDOFF.md`;
  independent review confirmed the diff and `git diff --check`. The Manager's
  own staging failure remains recorded as historical evidence; the parent
  Instructor persisted the reviewed control delta at `19164a6` after the
  environment denied the Manager's Git staging attempt.
- `TASKS.md` remains the sole operational-state authority: 43 rows total,
  `34 DONE`, `1 REVIEW` (`M-02`), and `8 BLOCKED` (`AU-02`, `S-04`, `E-02`,
  `L-02`, `F-03`, `I-01`, `I-02`, `I-03`). `N-03A` and its existing `N-03`
  closure are `DONE` and point to the integrated News checkpoint
  `f320b5f1d7731d121db27e788cffa4a8033dc7fd`.
- The `MVP_PLAN.md` DAG still requires the remaining E1/E2/E3 work and the
  baseline/security gates before `I-03` and final `I-02`. `AU-02` retains its
  `NEEDS_HUMAN_DECISION` boundary, and no unavailable PostgreSQL, real-provider,
  browser/demo, OpenSpec CLI, or link/DAG evidence is promoted to `PASS`.

### HOLD conditions and next review

- Keep the repository at this safe checkpoint. Do not infer authorization from
  any `READY` row or from the fact that `N-03`/`N-03A` are now `DONE`.
- The next Instructor review must re-read the current `MVP_PLAN.md`,
  `TASKS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, requirements, accepted ADRs, architecture, data
  model, active specs, and the source/tests for a selected frontier. It must
  verify Git cleanliness, the absence of active Manager/worker tasks, current
  dependencies, and a disjoint write scope before issuing a new signal.
- Any future implementation authorization must name its packet, requirement
  IDs, exact write scope, acceptance evidence, validation, dependencies,
  prohibitions, and stop condition. A fresh same-directory Manager must use
  `gpt-5.6-luna` with `max` reasoning, and any independent implementation must
  be delegated to an authorized worker.

## Historical INS-075 — Reconcile the audited INS-073 checkpoint

This historical signal superseded `INS-074 / HOLD` and authorized exactly one
fresh Manager for a control-plane-only reconciliation. It does not authorize a
worker, feature implementation, retry, replacement, duplicate, or downstream
start.

### Reviewed checkpoint and reason for reconciliation

- Branch: `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`.
- Reviewed base: `6727122` (`docs(control): hold after N-03A audit`); the
  working tree was clean at that checkpoint and no Cryptox Manager or worker
  was active.
- The independently reviewed N-03A source and tests, together with the
  Manager-owned task/checkpoint changes, are integrated at
  `f320b5f1d7731d121db27e788cffa4a8033dc7fd` (`feat(news): complete N-03A
  refresh scheduler`). The latest `HANDOFF.md` was written before that narrow
  integration and therefore still says the reviewed worker paths remain
  uncommitted. That statement must be reconciled by the Manager who owns the
  handoff artifact.
- Current task facts to preserve: `N-03A=DONE`, `N-03=DONE`, `M-02` is
  `REVIEW/UNVERIFIED`, and `AU-02`, `S-04`, `E-02`, `L-02`, `F-03`, `I-01`,
  `I-02`, and `I-03` are `BLOCKED`. No other task state may change.

### Exact Manager authorization

- Create exactly one fresh Manager in the canonical same-directory checkout
  `D:/agy-cli-projects/AOS/Cryptox`, branch `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`, using model
  `gpt-5.6-luna` with `max` reasoning. The Manager must read `AGENTS.md` and
  `docs/control/prompts/ORCHESTRATOR_START.md` completely, recover the current
  signal from Git, and verify the reviewed base, actual integration commit,
  task board, handoff, and absence of competing active tasks.
- This is Manager-owned governance reconciliation; no worker or subagent is
  authorized or needed. Do not create any worker, retry, replacement, branch,
  worktree, or duplicate task.
- **Exact write scope:** only `docs/implementation/TASKS.md` and
  `docs/implementation/HANDOFF.md`. The Manager must not edit
  `INSTRUCTOR.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `MVP_PLAN.md`, requirements, ADRs,
  architecture, data model, OpenSpec artifacts, source, tests, migrations,
  dependencies, frontend, backend composition, providers, or infrastructure.

### Acceptance and validation

- Reconcile the N-03A row and the latest INS-073 checkpoint so they identify
  the actual integrated checkpoint `f320b5f` and no longer claim the reviewed
  worker paths are uncommitted. Preserve the recorded Manager staging failure
  as historical evidence; do not rewrite it as a successful Manager commit.
- Preserve the exact `N-03A` and `N-03` `DONE` states and every unrelated task
  state, dependency, and stop boundary. Do not promote or start any other
  packet.
- Verify the final control-only diff contains no path outside the two allowed
  files, run `git diff --check` and applicable control-plane consistency checks,
  and record any unavailable check as `UNVERIFIED`/`BLOCKED`, never `PASS`.
- Attempt exactly one coherent Manager checkpoint commit containing only
  `TASKS.md` and `HANDOFF.md`. If Git staging/commit is denied, report the
  exact error once and do not retry; the parent Instructor will independently
  audit any remaining control delta.

### Stop condition

After the reconciliation and one commit attempt, stop immediately. This
signal authorizes no `M-02`, `S-04`, `E-02`, `L-02`, `F-03`, `AU-02`, `I-01`,
`I-02`, `I-03`, or any other implementation/closure packet. The next step is
an independent Instructor audit and a new `HOLD` signal.

### Evidence limitations

Real configured News/Binance, PostgreSQL/Docker runtime, browser/demo runtime,
OpenSpec CLI, and link/DAG automation remain `UNVERIFIED` or `BLOCKED` where
applicable. Fixtures and skipped tests are not promoted to `PASS`.

## Historical INS-074 — Independent post-INS-073 audit hold

This is the current Instructor signal and supersedes `INS-073 /
APPROVED_FOR_EXECUTION`. The N-03A implementation and N-03 closure passed
independent review and were integrated at commit `f320b5f1d7731d121db27e788cffa4a8033dc7fd`.
Execution is now on HOLD because the latest Manager checkpoint still contains
one stale statement about the worker paths being uncommitted.

### Verified checkpoint

- Branch: `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`; current HEAD is `f320b5f1d7731d121db27e788cffa4a8033dc7fd`.
- The working tree was clean after the audited integration commit. The commit
  contains only the three reviewed N-03A News paths and the Manager-owned
  `TASKS.md`/`HANDOFF.md` checkpoint changes; the Instructor did not implement
  feature code.
- `TASKS.md` records `N-03A=DONE` and `N-03=DONE`; `M-02` remains
  `REVIEW/UNVERIFIED`; `AU-02`, `S-04`, `E-02`, `L-02`, `F-03`, `I-01`,
  `I-02`, and `I-03` remain `BLOCKED`.
- The INS-073 Manager and its single News worker are complete and archived;
  no Cryptox Manager, worker, duplicate, or retry is active.

### Independent evidence

- N-03A scheduler `5/5`, News `35/35`, Sentiment `19/19`, and public News API
  `3/3` passed.
- Root workspace tests passed `346` with `6` environment-gated skips; skips
  are not PASS evidence. Root/package typecheck, build, lint, architecture,
  artifacts, deferred-scope/checker, and diff checks exited successfully.
- The worker changed only `modules/news/application/scheduler.ts`,
  `modules/news/application/scheduler.spec.ts`, and the minimal scheduler
  export in `modules/news/api/bootstrap.ts`. No contracts, infrastructure,
  migration, dependency, or unrelated source path changed.

### Reconciliation required before the next feature authorization

- The latest `HANDOFF.md` correctly records the Manager's one staging failure,
  but its final sentence still says the reviewed worker paths remain
  uncommitted. That is stale after `f320b5f`.
- The Instructor will not edit `TASKS.md` or `HANDOFF.md`. A fresh Manager must
  receive a separate control-only authorization to reconcile those two files
  with the actual integrated commit, then stop. No feature implementation,
  retry, replacement, downstream promotion, `M-02`, `AU-02`, `I-01`, `I-02`,
  or deferred packet is authorized under this HOLD.

### Evidence limitations

Real configured News/Binance, PostgreSQL/Docker runtime, browser/demo runtime,
OpenSpec CLI, and link/DAG automation remain `UNVERIFIED` or `BLOCKED` where
applicable. Fixtures and skipped tests are not promoted to PASS.

## Historical INS-073 — N-03A News auto-refresh completion and N-03 closure

This replaceable signal supersedes `INS-072 / HOLD` and authorizes exactly one
fresh Manager and exactly one fresh News worker for the residual `N-03A`
completion packet. It authorizes no retry of the completed N-03 worker, no
other implementation, and no downstream start.

### Reviewed checkpoint and current frontier

- Branch: `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`; current HEAD is `1fda6ad`
  (`docs(control): approve N-03A refresh completion`). The parent Instructor
  reviewed the governance-only plan/decision delta and Git is clean.
- The operational board currently contains 32 `DONE`, 2 `REVIEW` (`M-02`,
  `N-03`), and 8 `BLOCKED` (`AU-02`, `S-04`, `I-01`, `I-02`, `E-02`, `L-02`,
  `F-03`, `I-03`) rows, 42 existing rows total. `N-03A` is newly planned in
  `MVP_PLAN.md` and must be added as a separate operational row by the Manager
  before it is executable.
- M-03 is `DONE` under INS-071 at `280b280`; C-02, C-03, Q-02, B-03,
  ENV-03, and ENV-04 remain `DONE`. N-03 source/business state remains at
  `d4161ec458c869ff18fa89dd9732df260629c915`; its safe-fetch, extraction,
  retention, provenance, and neutral Sentiment evidence is preserved, but its
  checkpoint explicitly records that only the 1–5 minute setting/default exists
  and no scheduler is implemented.
- `DEC-014` and `MVP_PLAN.md` now define N-03A as completion of the approved
  `CSL-R-NW-02` behavior. They do not expand product scope, reopen N-03 source
  history, or authorize downstream tasks. Real PostgreSQL, configured Binance
  and News providers, browser/demo runtime, link/DAG automation, and OpenSpec
  CLI evidence remain `UNVERIFIED` or `BLOCKED` where recorded. No unavailable
  check, fixture, or skipped test is treated as `PASS`.

### Authorized packet and delegation

- Create exactly one fresh Manager in the canonical same-directory checkout
  `D:/agy-cli-projects/AOS/Cryptox`, branch `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION`, with model
  `gpt-5.6-luna` and `xhigh` reasoning. It must read `AGENTS.md` and
  `docs/control/prompts/ORCHESTRATOR_START.md` completely, then verify this
  signal, the new N-03A plan/decision, Git, TASKS, HANDOFF, the DAG,
  dependencies, and active tasks.
- The Manager must add exactly one `N-03A` operational row to `TASKS.md` in
  `READY` state, with the packet's requirement IDs, dependencies, exact scope,
  and stop evidence. It must then move only N-03A through
  `READY -> IN_PROGRESS` before dispatching the worker. Existing N-03 remains
  `REVIEW` until the residual acceptance is proven; it must not be retried or
  moved to another state before then.
- Delegate exactly one fresh News worker after the READY/dependency check. The
  worker must use the canonical same-directory checkout, must not create a
  thread/worker, branch, worktree, commit, or control-plane edit, and must not
  edit `TASKS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `INSTRUCTOR.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
  `MVP_PLAN.md`, requirements, ADRs, or OpenSpec artifacts. No retry,
  replacement, duplicate, or second worker is authorized.
- **Worker write scope:** `modules/news/api/**` excluding `contracts.ts` and
  contract-only tests; `modules/news/application/**`; and focused News
  scheduler tests in those boundaries. No infrastructure change is authorized;
  if the implementation genuinely requires one, stop and report
  `NEEDS_INSTRUCTOR_REVIEW`. No Sentiment, Strategy, frontend, backend
  composition root, contract, migration, dependency, credential, arbitrary
  URL, queue, distributed, or unrelated source change is authorized.
- **Manager-owned scope:** only `docs/implementation/TASKS.md` and
  `docs/implementation/HANDOFF.md` for the N-03A row, N-03 closure, review,
  and checkpoint. The Manager must preserve every unrelated task state and
  stop before S-04, E-02, L-02, F-03, I-01, I-02, I-03, AU-02, M-02, or any
  other packet.

### Acceptance and validation

- Implement a provider-neutral, application-owned, testable scheduler that
  accepts the existing configured 1–5 minute interval and five-minute default,
  invokes the existing public News collection at each interval, prevents
  overlapping collection runs, isolates a failed refresh so later ticks remain
  possible, and shuts down idempotently so no future tick runs. It must not
  perform direct remote fetching, persist timer state, log secrets, or create a
  queue/distributed worker protocol.
- Tests must cover cadence, default and invalid intervals, non-overlap, failure
  continuation, and shutdown using injected timer/clock seams. The public API
  must remain contract-compatible and later runtime integration must be able to
  consume the scheduler through the News boundary.
- The Manager must review exact changed paths and re-run the original N-03
  focused News/Sentiment tests plus N-03A tests, relevant public API tests,
  current checker and `scope:check`, architecture, artifacts, typecheck, build,
  lint, and `git diff --check`. Real configured News, PostgreSQL, browser/demo,
  OpenSpec CLI, and link/DAG automation remain `UNVERIFIED`/`BLOCKED` when
  unavailable; fixtures and skips are not live-provider evidence.
- If the residual evidence is complete, move N-03A through
  `IN_PROGRESS -> REVIEW -> DONE`, then move the existing N-03 exactly
  `REVIEW -> DONE` under this authorization and record both transitions. If a
  material premise is false, keep N-03A/N-03 at the safe state, record the
  exact blocker, and stop. Attempt one coherent Manager checkpoint commit
  containing only TASKS/HANDOFF; if Git staging/commit is denied, report it once
  and do not retry or broaden scope.
- The Manager must stop immediately after the N-03A review and optional N-03
  closure. No downstream promotion is implied by this instruction.
